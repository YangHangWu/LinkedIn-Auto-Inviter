# LinkedIn-Auto-Inviter
## Main Function
It a convenient tool that helps every job seeker asks for a referral on LinkedIn with a simple python file and Chrome webdriver.
After the one time setup, the only thing you need to modify is change the url of the people you want to ask for referral and the company name. 
The Auto-Inviter will send the connection request (according to the number you set) and send the message notes to the connectors.

## Motivation 
To every job seeker, I know it's challenge to get the first job or internship. 
The whole job seeking process is frustrated because you have to apply hundreds or even thousands of applications to get a few interview opportunities. 
One of the approaches to enhance your chance to stand out from the other applicants is to ask for a referral or connection from the current employees.   
However, not everyone on LinkedIn is willing to build up a connection with a stranger on LinkedIn. 
You have to request connections with more than 10 persons and maybe one of them will respond you.
As a software engineer, I am enthusiastic about applying programming skills to real world, which improves our lives. 
Therefore, I came out with this idea to build up a LinkedIn-Auto-Inviter which can automatically ask for a referral on LinkedIn (save lots of time)!!!  
I do get several offers with this tool so I decided to publish it to public. I hope it can somehow help people who are still struggling.
